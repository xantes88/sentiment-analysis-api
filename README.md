# sentiment-analysis-api
This project aims to implement an end-to-end sentiment analysis solution that classifies social media texts into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. It leverages a pre-trained FastText model and automates the workflow through a CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous deployment and monitoring.
Key Phases
Sentiment Analysis Model Implementation:

Use the pre-trained model available on HuggingFace: Twitter-roBERTa-base-sentiment-latest.
Process public datasets containing social media texts with labeled sentiments (e.g., positive, neutral, negative).
CI/CD Pipeline Setup:

Automate the training, testing, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions or similar tools.
Include integration tests to ensure consistent results and deploy the model to HuggingFace.
Deployment and Continuous Monitoring:

Deploy the application on HuggingFace for scalability and accessibility.
Implement monitoring tools to evaluate model performance over time and ensure accurate sentiment detection.
Deliverables
A public GitHub repository containing:
Scripts for preprocessing, training, and deploying the model.
A documented CI/CD workflow to automate processes.
Well-commented code for better usability and integration.
Comprehensive documentation detailing:
Project design decisions.
Tools and technologies used.
Model performance metrics and insights.
This project combines modern AI tools with robust deployment practices to create a scalable and maintainable sentiment analysis application.
