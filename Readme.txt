🚀 Sentiment Analysis API

Social Text Intelligence Powered by FastText & REST APIs

Overview

The Sentiment Analysis API is a lightweight and scalable RESTful service that classifies user-generated text—such as tweets, reviews, or customer messages—into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. It leverages a FastText pre-trained model and is fully containerized for rapid deployment, scalability, and CI/CD integration.

This project aims to empower businesses with real-time insights into public opinion, enabling smarter decisions in marketing, product, and customer service.

🌟 Business Value

“Sentiment is a signal. Capturing it at scale is a competitive advantage.”

Why this matters:

📣 Brand Monitoring: Instantly detect shifts in public sentiment about your brand.

🤝 Customer Support: Prioritize negative feedback and automate response routing.

🧠 Market Research: Analyze trends in customer perception across channels.

🎯 Product Feedback: Identify which features resonate or need improvement.

Integrating this API into your workflow turns passive text data into actionable sentiment intelligence.
